## ðŸ”¹ Manage Instances
```bash
multipass start <name>            # Start an instance
multipass stop <name>             # Stop an instance
multipass restart <name>          # Restart an instance
multipass suspend <name>          # Suspend an instance
multipass delete <name>           # Delete an instance (mark for deletion)
multipass purge                   # Remove all deleted instances permanently
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Access Instances
```bash
multipass shell <name>            # Open an interactive shell into an instance
multipass exec <name> -- <cmd>    # Run a command inside an instance
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ File Transfer
```bash
multipass transfer local.txt <name>:/home/ubuntu/   # Copy file to VM
multipass transfer <name>:/home/ubuntu/file.txt ./  # Copy file from VM to host
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Networking & Mounts
```bash
multipass networks                # List available networks
multipass set local.driver=qemu   # Change driver (Linux: qemu/KVM)
multipass mount ./data <name>:/data     # Mount local folder into instance
multipass umount <name>:/data           # Unmount folder from instance
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example Workflows
```bash
# Create a dev VM with Docker preinstalled
multipass launch --name docker-vm --mem 4G --disk 20G --cpus 2 --cloud-init docker.yaml

# Run a quick command on a VM
multipass exec docker-vm -- docker ps

# Copy project files into VM
multipass transfer ./project docker-vm:/home/ubuntu/project
```

âš¡ **Tip:** Multipass integrates great for **Docker Swarm/K8s testing** since you can quickly spin up multiple lightweight VMs and configure them as swarm managers/workers.
