  # Variables:
      > Variables are containers for storing data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        for example x = 1 here x is a variable
      
      > Rules for Python variables:
        * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        * A variable name cannot start with a number
        * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        * Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
        
      > Python allows us to assign values to multiple variables in one line: x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
        And we can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line: x = y = z = "Orange"
      
      > If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. 
         This is called unpacking. such as: 
                                            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                                            x, y, z = fruits //list unpacked here
      
      > We can not concatenate (or add) two data types. It's an TypeError
      
      > Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.
      
      > To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:
                                             x = "awesome"

                                             def myfunc():
                                               global x //changes x's value
                                               x = "fantastic"

                                             myfunc()
                                            
      

  # Data Types:
      > Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

                  * Text Type:	    str // "String" 'string'
                  * Numeric Types:	int, float, complex // 1, 1.1, 1A
                  * Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range // [], (), range()
                  * Mapping Type:	  dict // {"key": Value}
                  * Set Types:	    set, frozenset // x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} --> not key value pair
                  * Boolean Type:	  bool // True False
                  * Binary Types:	  bytes, bytearray, memoryview // b"Hello", bytearray(5), memoryview(bytes(5))
                  * None Type:	    NoneType //none

                  > to get the data type of any object by using the type() function: print(type())
