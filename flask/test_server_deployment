"""These steps may vary slightly depending on hosting provider but mostly same for all linux based servers""" 
"""This instructions are following Tech with Tim youtube video. link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFBRVJPhDGY"""

    #####  for apache server ####

step 1: open up local ssh shell/ unix terminal/ putty(for windows)

step 2: login to remote server via ssh
    cmd: ssh username@remote_host_ip
      -->then type password on prompt
step 3: after logging in do a system wide update
    cmd: sudo apt update
   
step 4: install apache 
    cmd: sudo apt install apache2
    
step 5: check if apache server running
    cmd: apache2 -version

step 6: if apache running without error configure host firewall
    to check firewall list 
    cmd: sudo ufw app list

step 7: if apache in list then allow it in firewall
    cmd: sudo ufw allow 'Apache'

step 8: configure apache and see if it's actually running
    cmd: sudo systemctl status apache2
        
        if apache active and running it will show in green. to exit from that config shell press ctrl+c

step 9: now next step is to install few libraries. first mod-wsgi for python3. 
    warning: in the video cmd: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev is not working for python3. so use command below:
      
      cmd: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3   --> note:(working!)
