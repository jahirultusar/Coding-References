After creating a virtual environment..
    # Install pandas: pip install pandas
    # to use jupyter notebook: pip install jupyterlab 
    

once setup is done open desired csv file from working directory start jupyter notebook server by command
    # jupyter notebook #Note: if kernel error happens in jupyter fix it by jupyter notebook reference 
    
in jupyter open a new notebook. then
    # import pandas as pd
      
to order to open our csv
     # df = pd.read_csv('survey_results_public.csv') 
            // Note: df is dataframe. basically dataframe are the rows and columns of data! pd.read_csv is for pandas reading csv and the pass csv filename in parenthesis in quotation mark

to order to open our csv
     # schema_df = pd.read_csv('survey_results_schema.csv') 

to find out how many rows and columns:
    # df.shape // output will be (number of rows, number of columns)
    or
    # df.info() // output will be more defined
    
to see all the columns change the setting via pandas
    # pd.set_option('display.max_columns', number_of_colimns_we_want_to_see)
