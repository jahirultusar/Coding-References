# To remove all Docker containers, images, and networks from your system, you can use the following commands:

Stop all running containers:

bash cmd:

  sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -aq)
  Remove all containers:

bash cmd:

  sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)
  Remove all images:

bash cmd:

  sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -aq)
  Remove all networks:

bash cmd:

  sudo docker network prune


*** Please note that these commands will remove all Docker containers, images, and networks from your system, so use them with caution. Make sure you have backups or copies of any important data before proceeding.

  
  # ADVANCED TRICKS

If you're unable to remove Docker images because they are being used by stopped containers, you can force the removal of both the containers and images using the docker rm and docker rmi commands with the --force or -f option.

Here's the modified sequence of commands to force the removal of containers and images:

Stop and remove all containers:

bash cmd:

  sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -aq)

Remove all images:
bash cmd:
  sudo docker rmi -f $(sudo docker images -aq)

*** Please note that forcing the removal of containers and images will permanently delete them, and any data stored within them will be lost. Make sure you have backups or copies of any important data before proceeding.
