check for existing key:
  > ls -al ~/.ssh
  
  if exists there will be file name like:
    
    id_ed25519
    id_ed25519.pub
    
    or     
    
    id_rsa
    id_rsa.pub
    
if doesnt exists then we need to create one

step 1: open a terminal and type:
  > ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<label>"
  
  note: Using the label, you can label your SSH keys. 
  If we are creating this ssh key pair only for connecting to GitHub, 
  we can consider using the “<username@Github>” format as your label.
  
  If system does not support the Ed25519 algorithm, 
  you can use the RSA algorithm instead:
  
  > ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<label>"
  
  
  Adding to SSH-agent:
  
  Now that we have an SSH key pair, we can add our keys to the ssh-agent.
  ssh-agent is a key manager for SSH. Adding the keys to the ssh-agent saves you from typing the passphrase again and again.
  To add our keys to the ssh-agent we start the ssh-agent in the background.
  > eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  
  Now that we have our ssh-agent started, we add our key pair to the ssh.
  > ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  
  Note: If we have used a different directory/filename during key creation, replace ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 with the key location
