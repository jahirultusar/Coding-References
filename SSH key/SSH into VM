#1 make sure SSH is running in VM 

#2 make sure VM is in bridged-network! IMPORTANT
  i.e. for multipass:
  $ make sure multipass instance is stop
  $ multipass networks #check multipass network
  $ multipass set local.bridged-network=enp34s0 #your enp34s0 or network name might be different
  $ multipass set local.terraformPad.bridged=true #your terraformPad or multipass instance name here
  $ multipass get local.terraformPad.bridged #check if network is bridged with the multipass instance

alternate option #2: copy ssh pub id from local to vm manually

#3 find VM ip address
  cmd: ip addr
