This is a basic JS readme file includes installation etc.

to install JS and node.js first time in a machine we are gonna use npm package manager for JavaScript.

Step 1: install latest npm
  cmd: npm install -g npm
  
  verify installation:
    cmd: npm -v (if a version no there then its installed!)
  
step 2: install node.js
  cmd: sudo apt install nodejs
  
  verify installation
    cmd: node -v (if a version number there then its installed!)
    
// comment in JS
  single line comment:  //this is a comment
  multiline comment: /* This is a
                       multiline comment*/
                       
strings: like python anything in 'single' and "double quotes" are strings

# semicolon or not?
  Even though JS doesnt enforce it but good to do semicolons for standards
