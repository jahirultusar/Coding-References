"""This is a walkthrough of customr domain configuration after cloud server setup"""

DNS or Domain Name System is a naming system or identifier for web, site, app and services. like google has an address: 8.8.8.8
In this document I will explain the checklist and the process of acquiring an IP Address for a web app.

# DNS Set-Up Checklist

  step 1: Register (purchase) a domain name if you haven't already.
          
          After you purchase a domain, log in to your domain register,s control panel and set the name servers for your domain name to 
          the desired name servers. name servers usually provided by hosting company like AWS, Godaddy etc
          
  step 2: Set your domain name to desired server where your web app is. It may take upto 24 hours or more for the change to take effect.
  step 3: Use the DNS manager to add some basic DNS records.
  step 4: Set reverse DNS (if needed)
  step 4: If you have any special DNS needs, such as using a third-party email server, add additional DNS records to create a custom configuration.
