    #####  for apache server ####

step 1: open up local ssh shell/ unix terminal/ putty(for windows)

step 2: login to remote server via ssh
    cmd: ssh username@remote_host_ip
      -->then type password on prompt
step 3: after logging in do a system wide update
    cmd: sudo apt update
   
step 4: install apache 
    cmd: sudo apt install apache2
    
step 5: check if apache server running
    cmd: apache2 -version

step 6: if apache running without error configure host firewall
    to check firewall list 
    cmd: sudo ufw app list

step 7: if apache in list then allow it in firewall
    cmd: sudo ufw allow 'Apache'

step 8: configure apache and see if it's actually running
    cmd: sudo systemctl status apache2
        
        if apache active and running it will show in green. to exit from that config shell press ctrl+c

step 9: now next step is to install few libraries. first mod-wsgi for python3. 
    warning: in the video cmd: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev is not working for python3. so use command below:
      
      cmd: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3   --> note:(working!)
      
step 10: now we need to go to te directory where we are gonna deploy our flask app. in this case cd to
    cmd: cd /var/www/
    
    then in /var/www make a new directory, in this case 
        cmd: mkdir webApp (this will create a new folder or directory named: webApp. it's important to remeber this name for later!)
        
    now cd into webApp or the directory name we just created
        cmd:  cd webApp
        
step 11: now in webApp we are gonna install python3 and pip (make sure we are in right directory, in this case webApp)
    cmd: sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    
    now check python version and pip version just in case before next step
    cmd: python3 --version
    cmd: pip3 --version
    
    after all those checks out, we are gonna install flask and the database library like SQLite or SQlAlchemy.
    !note: please make sure to go back or cd to the app directory(in this case: cd /var/www/webApp) everytime we back out from shell
    
step 12: install flask in webApp directory
    cmd:
